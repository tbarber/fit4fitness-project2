    <h3>DIET TIP OF THE DAY- GAINING/LOOSING WEIGHT ON A BUDGET!!!!</h3>
 <p>   
 Peanut butter is high in calories and fat at 188 calories and 16 grams of fat (good fat with omega3,6 fatty acids) per two tablespoon serving. It is also a good source of protein at 8 grams per two tablespoon serving. It is best to use all natural peanut butter that will cost you approx $4-$5. Throw it on some whole grain wheat bread which is high in complex carbs so you have long lasting energy for your day for approx. $2-$3 a loaf. A single large hard-boiled egg contains about 6.5 grams of protein and they only cost approx. $1.75 a dozen. Since eggs are fast-digesting forms of protein, eat them in a post-workout meal as well! I personally eat this for breakfast allmost every morning! For only $8, you have a meal that will last you 2weeks...WOW! For people trying to loose weight, you may want to buy low calorie whole grain bread or just eat 1 slice of bread with peanut butter on it
Oatmeal for Breakfast
Add oatmeal to your breakfast smootie/shake. Oatmeal is a complex carbohydrate that will give you long lasting energy for your day and plus its good for the heart!
Summer Time Snack!
Cut up fresh fruit into bite size pieces. Put them into a freezer safe container into your freezer. Take them out when they are frozen and enjoy! Suck on them like hard candy. This will prevent you from eating over your portion and there good to eat in the summer time <a href="#">Read More</a>

    <h3> ABout Me</h3>
    <p>
    A little bit about me, I was born in Minneapolis, MN. Growing up I dealt with weight problems myself, mainly form eating. In the 7th grade I got up to 205lbs. and I was 5'8. I was obese. It was hard. I got teased and picked up on by my family and friends. I use to go to my grandparents house in the summer time during break. I still can hear my grandfather now, “Boy, go and run around the block. You’re not going to sit here and eat all day and get fat.” With all the added pressures, it took me a while to realize what I was becoming. Through it all, I always loved sports. I finally joined the community basketball league with my friends and had the best time of my life. I ended up joining tae kwon doe, running hurdles on the track team, became a lineman on the football team, while continuing to play basketball. In high school I added tennis to this list. I wasn’t the greatest in all of them, but sports kept me active. Being on a team and having a coach kept me accountable to try my hardest and be all I could be. I played varsity for every sport except basketball. I gave up on going to the NBA after I stop growing taller. No one wants a 6’1 power forward. Playing sports kept me in tune with my body and taught me different skills that I applied to everything I do in life now!
After high school, I went on to college on a football scholarship to Jamestown College.<a href="#">Read More</a>

    <h3>My Style</h3>
    
    <p>
    
I consider myself, what I call, a core progressive trainer. Most people what to lose their stomachs, but you can’t spot reduce fat. Through maximizing your calorie burn, it will soon go away! Your core is the powerhouse of the body. Your core is made up of a group of muscles which include; rectus/transverse abdominals (abs), obliques, gluteus maximus, erector spinae (lower back), and psoas major/iliacus (hip flexors). When you incorporate these muscles while working your stabilizer muscles through various exercises, you are able to maximize your workout routine. This allows you to be more fine-tuned with the awareness of your own body, which aids in building more muscle and increasing your muscle endurance. To progress this, you simply advance the difficulty of the exercise. The progression of advance exercises is where most people plateau and give up on reaching their fitness goals, because they simply just don’t know how to do them.
I am an educator. I don’t just train you and leave you hanging. I educate you on how you can turn your life around and apply what I teach you to your everyday life. It’s not all about just getting to your fitness goals. It’s about creating a healthy lifestyle you can be consistent with so that you feel great and live longer!<a href="#">Read More</a>
